Today I would like to talk about how to become a good OSINT investigator, but to continue the conversation I would like to make a small disclaimer - I will tell you only some aspects because the topic is very vast and I can not describe everything in a single guide, however, I will try to show you the way and how to pass this path. This manual is the culmination of years of work by OSINT professionals. Consider this guidebook to be a compilation of advice and routes!

Keep in mind, this essay is intended to be instructional! Consider your actions carefully or you will be prosecuted or worse! Always keep in mind Ethics & related Laws - like GDPR, etc… You should not romanticize OSINT and on-chain investigations in the same manner that individuals often romanticize hacking and warfare, I highly encourage you!

- [Vicarious trauma](https://osintcurio.us/2020/06/08/vicarious-trauma-and-osint-a-practical-guide/)

> Last but not least, everything you do is based on the outcomes you need to achieve! You should be able to select reliable and vetted sources instead of using all the tools and links. Through given routes, you ought to be able to construct your own journey! Following that, I will tell you about the ways that I deem safe and recommend to my clients! OSINT professionals have spent decades developing this manual, sharing their expertise in every word. Once again, consider this guidebook to be a compilation of advice and routes.

It is also crucial to note that OSINT is merely another means to learn about the world around you and is not a way to "get paid instantly." Always take a break to recharge! Your health & mind are important!

Always think twice before acting, follow the law, and follow the OpSec rules. If you want to help or conduct social investigations but lack experience, please reach out to more experienced people so that you do not harm the victims or those attempting to save them. In my articles, on the other hand, I reveal a different application of OSINT, inspired by due diligence and civil financial intelligence, with a focus on **civilian** applications. That is my vision, which I hope you will embrace...

# Introduction: Civil OSINT

To begin with, I want to say that I will consider OSINT as a set of skills or a mindset, because it can be directly related to doxing, military GEO-INT performed by a security company employee or just media OSINT performed by a VC fund employee in order to find new projects for investment, taking the theory of handshakes as a basis...

All of what I said above you can develop in yourself, but the essence of all directions is the same - the ability to notice valuable information, anomalies, see the differences, carefully analyze the facts and build a logical chain - while being in the flow of information. Start up from checking out your own info and your own data: make an OSINT research against yourself. Collect all data, visualize it, then, erase - with using SERM/ORM techniques.

# Mind-Mapping

First, let's break down such a concept as mind-mapping. It is very important to teach how to sort information according to different criteria, I believe you can practice sorting absolutely any information you’d like!

- [Mind-map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)
- [Gitmind Tool](http://gitmind.com/)
- [What do you need to become an intermediate OSINTer? How can Shodan contribute to OSINT investigations?](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/osintcurious/episode-51-what-do-you-need-to-become-an-intermedi/)

**[What is Maltego and why use it for OSINT?](https://wondersmithrae.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-osint-investigation-with-maltego-6b195f7245cc)** Maltego is a data mining tool that mines a variety of open-source data resources and uses that data to create graphs for analyzing connections. The graphs allow you to easily make connections between information such as name, email organizational structure, domains, documents, etc. Maltego uses Java so it can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux and is available in many OSINT Linux distros like Buscador or Kali. 

Basically, it will parse a large amount of information and search various open-source websites for you and then toss out a pretty looking graph that will help you put the pieces together. Maltego can be used as a resource at any point during the investigation however if your target is a domain it makes sense to start mapping the network with Maltego from the start.

#### Didn't everyone make cheat sheets at school? It's time to do it again, because in the future it should evolve into a Maltego skill!

A thorough examination of [publicly available](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/y7qzSLS8qZuU_fdHcrYyN7eZxGzfo_Z5avmNHqhbrZU) information can increase the chances of finding a vulnerable system, gaining valid credentials through password spraying, or gaining a foothold via social engineering.

# Immersive & Gamified Learning: Tricks (a)

I can also recommend that you turn to an interesting subculture that is suitable for introverts! I am sure that everyone is interested in various strange phenomena in one way or another. Immerse yourself in a net-stalking environment! 

Sometimes ordinary people were able to solve crimes which the police could not solve for years with OSINT and GEOINT alone (I could put in here links to subreddits, movies and news but since you and I are now doing OSINT I advise you to find it on your own).

**Cognitive bias mitigation & decision-making when doing OSINT:**

There are no perfect practitioners-analysts, everyone makes mistakes and gets into difficult ambiguous situations (at least once in their life), all the more in conditions of acutely intensive and chronic work overload. And it is absolutely necessary for a practitioner-analyst to know and understand such situations. 

Cognitive vulnerabilities (in the established understanding) are exposures and/or tendencies to defects in thinking: significant cognitive distortions, erroneous beliefs, cognitive biases (biases), or stereotyped patterns of thinking that create the basis for a person's predisposition to cognitive failures and lead to distortions and dysfunctions of [thought processes](https://telegra.ph/Cognitive-vulnerabilities-of-the-practitioner-analyst-04-17).

Most of us experience 'gut feelings' we can't explain, such as instantly loving (or hating) a new property when we're househunting or the snap judgments we make on meeting new people. Now researchers say these feelings (or intuitions) - are real and we should take our hunches seriously. 

Don't limit yourself to one approach; don't be afraid to try experiments, but keep in mind that the outcomes of such approaches should always be **double-checked**. They serve more as learning tools than as actual advice for investigators. Visit the following websites:

- [Intuition Is More Than Just A Hunch, Says New Research](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080305144210.htm)
- [Intuition as Emergence: Bridging Psychology, Philosophy and Organizational Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.787428/full)
- [Intelligence Analysis: Structured Methods or Intuition?](https://www.academia.edu/4259879/Intelligence_Analysis_Structured_Methods_or_Intuition)
- [The Potential of Integrating Intelligence and Intuition](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/the-potential-of-integrating-intelligence-and-intuition)

**Also:**

**According to [wondersmith_rae](https://wondersmithrae.medium.com/training-yourself-to-be-an-analytical-thinker-476bdb7e7c99)**: In classical rhetoric, the “elements of circumstance” created by Aristotle have been used to analyze rhetorical questions for ages. They also apply to modern-day analysis and can be used as a foundation for an investigation. **(Who, what, when, where, why, in what way, by what means)**

A condensed yet equally valuable version of the elements is called the “5W’s and an H” or Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. These questions have been used in rhetoric, religious study, police investigations, journalism, and by lawyers since ancient Greece. It is said that an investigation can not be truly complete until all of the Ws and the H can be answered. 

Applying the same elements to our OSINT investigations we can ask and answer similar questions. By [answering](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/y7qzSLS8qZuU_fdHcrYyN7eZxGzfo_Z5avmNHqhbrZU) the 5W’s a narrative begins to emerge from our collected data. It is now up to us as analysts to connect the dots in a succinct way. The catch is, that anyone who has done research knows that when information starts to be uncovered it is easy to get stuck in a rabbit hole.

Once you can distinguish the information, sort it out then the next thing you can do is start practicing. As you know, **good practice requires good motivation**! You only need to know one thing: people think that intelligence is fixed — but it isn’t. Your brain is like a muscle; the more you use it, the more it grows. Education is no longer a one-time event, but a lifelong experience.

**Tools (AI, ChatGPT, ML, Others):**

> [In recent years, public interest in open-source intelligence gathering and analysis](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/atmic-talk-osint-mind-state-online-investigations-114115/) has increased exponentially. As this interest has grown, more and more OSINT investigations have been relying on tools and automation, leaving the analysis process behind. You should consider OSINT a thought process. The "OSINT state of mind" is key for keeping track of your investigative steps, picking the right tools and sources, analyzing the data, and reporting to generate actionable intelligence!

# Choosing a Pathway to Follow...

Some will enjoy [analyzing images](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-magnifier), [satellite images](https://spectator.earth/), calculating time and place from [the angle of shadows from a photo](https://www.suncalc.org/#/40.1789,-3.5156,3/2022.05.05/12:15/1/3), or measuring mountain [peak size](https://www.peakfinder.org/) in order to perform private detective investigations. Or, let's say, doing OSINT in crypto, for example, in which case your motivation will be money and self-fulfillment... Or [searching for rare stories](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/buying-volcanoes-robert-ripley-paricutin-whakaari.amp) even!

[Read my channel if you like this topic](https://t.me/officer_cia)... Or someone can even get into [AD-INT](https://medium.com/@ibederov_en/mac-address-osint-e539504ae925) which is growing day-by-day right now. For GEOINT skills training I suggest checking [geoguessr.com](https://geoguessr.com/) & [whereami.io](https://whereami.io/).

# Work: A-Z

I would see it as learning a foreign language. Okay, you have learned it and come to a country where it is spoken to live. But everyone there knows this language... So it's important to know something else in addition. Typically, it is necessary to have writing skills, interact well with people, or be a lawyer. With all said, different approaches require different skills and mind-sets!

> Keep in mind that OSINT is NOT a "sort of a [front-running/tailgating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp) or scalping but in real life"!

**Specific (to be updated):**

> **According to [GoldenOwl](https://osintteam.blog/safeguarding-osinters-shielding-against-disinformation-manipulation-dfbbfbf1db08):** As the battle against disinformation intensifies, OSINT practitioners must be vigilant in protecting themselves from manipulation. By adopting a critical mindset, diversifying information sources, verifying social media information, utilizing fact-checking tools, staying updated on disinformation techniques, collaborating with trusted communities, educating others, [maintaining ethical standards](https://osintteam.blog/safeguarding-osinters-shielding-against-disinformation-manipulation-dfbbfbf1db08), and cross-checking information, OSINTers can fortify themselves against manipulation and uphold the integrity of their research.

> **According to [Alessandra Adina](https://medium.com/@alessandraadina/how-to-do-cyber-reconnaissance-a-guide-to-osint-for-non-tech-professionals-da6c7db48699):** The intelligence cycle represents the process of developing raw information into actionable intelligence. This process can enable decision-makers to take appropriate actions based on their findings. While different organisations use variations on different intelligence cycles, a popular one is a five-step cycle: **Planning, Gathering, Analyzing, Dissemination, and Feedback.**

> **According to [Alessandra Adina](https://medium.com/@alessandraadina/how-to-do-cyber-reconnaissance-a-guide-to-osint-for-non-tech-professionals-da6c7db48699):** A term you may come across in the realm of OSINT is ‘grey literature.’ These are internal documents not intended for public use, but unfortunately, they can easily end up in places where they are searchable. Examples include technical reports, newsletters, invoices, business proposals, or requests for proposals.

> Understanding the value of your organisation’s information, potential attack vectors, and who might be targeted in phishing attacks or other types of social engineering is essential. OSINT can aid you in assessing these risks and planning appropriate defences.
